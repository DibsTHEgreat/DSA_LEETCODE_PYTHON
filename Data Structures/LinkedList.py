## This file contains my observations and notes about Linked Lists
## I have also created my own Linked List Class to understand the DS

## Observations

## Linked Lists(LL) do not have indexes.
## LL is a type of list that is in a contiguous place in memory, as in, all elements are all right next to each other in memory.
## With a LL all the nodes are going to be spread all over the place.

## Also with a LL there is a variabled called head which points to the first node in a LL
##   head                tail
##    |                    |
##   (1) -> (2) -> (3) -> (4) -> None (null)
